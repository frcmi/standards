# 5937 Git standards

## `main`/`dev` split

- `main` needs to always be a stable, clean mirror of `dev`
- Only team leads (Johnny, Ethan, Nora) can push into main.
- Absolutely **NO** merging from `main` into `dev`. This is in order to avoid merge conflicts.
- Small changes that do not have the scope of a full "feature" can be pushed to `dev`.
- Absolutely **NO** force pushing.

## Feature branches

- Split larger features (>3d) into smaller features.
- Consult with Nora for approval before creating a feature branch
- Have a pull request ready by **3 DAYS** after you created the branch
- No stack pull requests
- If a pull request is not ready, talk to Nora
- Feature branches are only necessary if your feature is larger than one commit.
